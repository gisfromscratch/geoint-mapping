geoint-mapping
--------------
Core mapping and Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) capabilities for Python.

Introduction
------------

Using GEOINT capabilities to best effect, one must possess a deep understanding of various concepts and principles related to geography, cartography, remote sensing, image analysis, data management, and visualization. In addition, knowledge of geospatial data formats and standards, as well as geospatial analysis techniques and statistical methods, is essential for effectively analyzing and interpreting geospatial data.

Expertise in geospatial tools and technologies, such as GIS software, satellite imagery processing software, and various types of remote sensing sensors, is essential for effectively capturing, processing, analyzing, and visualizing geospatial data. Finally, a strong understanding of the ethical and legal implications of GEOINT is also critical for ensuring that the information gained through geospatial analysis is used ethically and appropriately.

GEOINT tools assemble ready-to-use very high readiness joint geospatial capabilities. You can use these geospatial capabilities to build and extend various mapping and GEOINT enabled applications.

Why is it important?
--------------------

Geospatial Knowledge refers to semantic information about specific locations on the Earthâ€™s surface. It includes location-enabled things - not strings - like physical features of the landscape, the location of cities or in general human activities, and their spatial distribution. Various sources like satellite imagery, location-enabled datasets, and most important any location-enabled information in the context of Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) are used to create Geospatial Knowledge. By analyzing location-enabled things an analyst is empowered to gain insights into various aspects of human activities.

Software Requirements
---------------------

geoint-mapping depends on the following software packages:

- [ArcGIS Maps SDK for Qt - Version 200.2](https://developers.arcgis.com/qt/): ArcGIS Maps SDK for Qt has APIs for developing desktop apps for Windows, Linux, and macOS, and mobile apps for iOS and Android. You can install the API on Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- [Qt SDK - Version 6.5.2](https://doc.qt.io/): The future is written with Qt, the cross-platform software development framework.
- [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11): Seamless operability between C++11 and Python.
